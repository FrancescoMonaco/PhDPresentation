# The Problem
A continuos increase in the volume of data

 - Many mining algorithms scale with super linear behaviors
 - We need to find efficient techniques to deal with this data
 - We want to have theoretical guarantees on the performance of our algorithms and the quality of the results

# Algorithms with Predictions
A predictor for hash indices

- <span v-mark.orange="1"> Setting</span>:
    Hash indices, structures to answer Approximate Near Neighbor Queries, are used for many downstream tasks like clustering, recommender systems or pattern matching.

    Some hash indices, like PUFFINN*, are data adaptive and don't need have a set of parameters to tune.

- <span v-mark.red="2"> Problem</span>:
     Data adaptive hash indices are usually slower than the non-adaptive ones during the search operation, we would like to keep the data adaptive property while making it competitive with carefully hash indices.

- <span v-mark.green="3"> Solution</span>:
    We implement a predictor based on clusters and coresets that drives the search of the hash index. Saving time during the search operation.

# Algorithms with Predictions
A Bloom filter predictor for distance approximations

- <span v-mark.orange="1"> Setting</span>:
    Computing distances between elements is fundamental in tasks of similarity search.

- <span v-mark.red="2"> Problem</span>:
    Computing distances is expensive, especially in high dimensional spaces. We want to approximate the distance between two elements using a small subset of their dimensions.
    Current methods to approximate distances have known problems on robustness.

- <span v-mark.green="3"> Solution</span>:
    We implement a sensitive Bloom filter to select the most relevant dimensions to be used in the distance approximation. We use the filter rapresentation to estimate the remaining dimensions.

# Algorithms with Predictions
A predictor for hash ensembles
- <span v-mark.orange="1"> Setting</span>:
     Ensembles are a family of algorithms that use multiple models to improve the performance. They are used in many neural tasks.

- <span v-mark.blue="2"> Idea</span>:
    We want to extend the idea of ensembles to the hash setting. We want to use multiple hash indices to improve the performance of the search.

- <span v-mark.green="3"> Solution</span>:
    We implement an ensembles of hash indices, indices will complement each other on different data distributions. A predictor will be used to select the best hash index for the current data distribution.
