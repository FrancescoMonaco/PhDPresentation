# The Setting
A continuos increase in the volume of data

<br>

 - We want to analyze and extract information from large amounts of data.

 - We need to find efficient techniques to deal with this data.

 - Many mining algorithms scale with super linear time complexity.

# The Setting
Similarity Search

<br>

- Similarity search is a fundamental task where we want to find the most similar elements in a collection of elements.
<br>

- In particular, we are interested in the Approximate Near Neighbor Search (ANNS) problem.

   - Given a set of elements and a query, we want to find the elements in the set <span v-mark.green = "1">that are closest</span> to the query.
   - This procedure is used in applications like time series analysis to find common patterns, Minimum Spanning Tree to find the minimal edges, recommender systems to find similar elements to propose.

# A Recent Development
Algorithms with Predictions

<br>

- Algorithms with predictions is a new framework to design algorithms that use a <span v-mark.yellow="1">predictor</span> to improve their performance.

- They keep the theoretical guarantees of the original algorithm while improving their performance in the <span v-mark.yellow="2">average case</span>.

- The predictors are usually neural models <span v-mark.red="3">trained</span> on data that is similar to the one used in the algorithm.

# Algorithms with Predictions
The current challenges

<br>

- Neural predictors need to be trained using specific techniques (e.g., <span v-mark.orange="1">conformal or calibrated predictions</span>) 

- Need lots of data to reach theoretical guarantees on the predictions.

- Not easy to deploy in real-world applications.

<br>

<span v-mark.circle.green="2">Idea</span>:

- We can use hash structures to obtain deployable and robust predictors.

---

# Goals of the project
What is the plan?
<br>

- We want to integrate hash structures in the algorithms with predictions framework.

    - We obtain robust predictors that are easy to initialize and deploy.
    - We address the challenges posed by high-dimensional data in ANNS.
    - We derive mechanisms that can be expandend in several downstream tasks.

- We expand in the offline setting.

    - The algorithm with predictions framework started for streaming data.
    - In the last months some works showed that it is beneficial also in the offline one.

# A predictor for hash indices
Faster ANN search

<br>

- <span v-mark.orange="1"> Setting</span>:
    Hash indices, structures to answer Approximate Near Neighbor Queries, are used for many downstream tasks like clustering, recommender systems or pattern matching.

    Some hash indices, like PUFFINN*, are data adaptive and don't have a set of parameters to tune, making them more general.

- <span v-mark.red="2"> Problem</span>:
     Data adaptive hash indices are usually slower than the non-adaptive ones during the search operation, we would like to reduce search time.

- <span v-mark.green="3"> Solution</span>:
    We implement a predictor based on clusters and coresets that drives the search of the hash index. Saving time during the search operation.

# A Bloom filter predictor for distance approximations
Faster distance computations in ANN

<br>

- <span v-mark.orange="1"> Setting</span>:
    Computing distances between elements is fundamental in tasks of ANN.

- <span v-mark.red="2"> Problem</span>:
    Computing distances is expensive, especially in high dimensional spaces. We want to approximate the distance between elements using a small subset of their dimensions.
    Current methods to approximate distances have known problems on robustness.

- <span v-mark.green="3"> Solution</span>:
    We implement a sensitive Bloom filter predictor to select the most relevant dimensions and estimate the distance between elements. We expect it to be robust given the theoretical properties of the Bloom filter.

# Extra
A Computer Vision application

- A CNN is used conjunctly with an LSTM to create a textual description of the people in a video stream.

- To reverse search in a video from a textual description a hash index is used to find the matching frames.

- The description creates a textual embedding, ANN search finds the closest frames in the hash index, the frames are then retrieved and the CNN is used to find the people in the frames.

An industry application

- A hash index is used to cluster behaviours of a set of sensors in an incinerator.

- A dictionary of behaviours helps the recognition of anomalies.

- The project was carried out in collaboration with beanTech IT.

# A predictor for hash ensembles
Improving quality for drifting data

<br>

- <span v-mark.orange="1"> Setting</span>:
     Ensembles are a family of algorithms that use multiple models to improve the performance. They are used in many neural tasks. Extremely useful to deal with data drift.

- <span v-mark.blue="2"> Idea</span>:
    We want to extend the idea of ensembles to the hash setting. We want to use multiple hash indices to improve the performance of the search and support mixture data.

- <span v-mark.green="3"> Solution</span>:
    We implement an ensembles of hash indices, indices will complement each other on different data distributions. A predictor will be used to select the best hash index for the current data distribution.
